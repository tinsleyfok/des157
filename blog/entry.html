    I really like the App Patterning. It is very powerful and the design is very beautiful. Patterning is a very flexible drum 
    machine. The circular at the first page is very elegant. It can transforms my iPad into a tool for making sounds and beats.
    It is very fun!The app is super smart but minimal UI makes complicated songs. The visual design is very clear and the color 
    is very comfortable looking. I really love sounds and beats, I always have fun with this App. 
    
    The design is very innovative. The disc like circular interface, with green and orange scale color, is very eye-catching. I always create dynamic drum patterns by only swiping my fingers. if linking to the blue tooth speaking, it likes making rhythms 
    for the party. There is also others songs insides the App. It is wonderful.

    User Interface is more and more popular nowadays. As a communication and design major student, I hope I always can create some simple, functionable and attractive visual designs like this App. No matter what kind of visual design, like, poster for exhibitions, concerts, or websites for a company or a campaign, or even a interactive application in Apple store. I always hope my design is clean, simple, beautiful and most importantly, helpful.
